#Integration Project, rough draft
#COP1500
#This program is a calculator that solves any 1 dementional motion kinematic equation.
#This draft assumes that the user has a basic conceptual understanding of 1D Kinematics
#This draft only computes whole numbers
#the "%" and "//" opperators were used to satisfy rubric; will be used better in second draft that incoperates functions
